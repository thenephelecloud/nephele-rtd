# Documentation Repository README

## Overview

This repository contains the markdown files for the documentation of our decentralized file sharing protocol and related tools. It includes guides and references for using our File Transfer API, interacting with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), exploring data blobs using Blobscan, and verifying proofs of file ownership and integrity.

## Structure

The documentation is organized into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the system:

- **File Transfer API**: Instructions and examples for using the API to upload and download files.
- **EVM Interaction**: Guides for interacting with the EVM chain and using the FileStorage smart contract.
- **Exploring Blobs**: Information on how to use Blobscan and Ethereum Node RPC to explore data blobs.
- **Verifying Proofs**: Steps for using the Verifier tool to validate proofs of file ownership and integrity.

Each section is contained within its own markdown file for ease of navigation and updates.
